Chartered Waters is a procedurally generated game set in a fictional Age of Sail. Heavily inspired by the game series Uncharted Waters, and in particular Great Age of Sail Online, the aim of the project was to create a world with a living economy and agents acting as merchants capable of making informed decisions, painting a backdrop on which the player could make her decisions and affect the economy.
